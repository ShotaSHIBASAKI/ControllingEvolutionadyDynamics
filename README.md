# ControllingEvolutionadyDynamics
Python codes and csv files used in Shibasaki and Mitri 2019 (*bioRxiv*) "Controlling evolutionary dynamics to optimize microbial bioremedation".
You can replicate the simulation, figures, and calculations with the codes. 
There are also some csv files used drowing some figures.

## FigsMainText.py
This code includes the functions to drow the figures in the main text (except for Figs. 1A, 2A, 3, and 5A).
For analysis of Markov chian models in Figs. 5B (ergodic one) or A.11A (non-ergodic one), you can also see MarkovChain.c. The two csv files, "optDPMC_ergodics.csv", and "optDPMC_Nonergodic.csv" provide the optimal intruction rates of cooperators in each model given a time step, respectively. 

## Appendix1.py
